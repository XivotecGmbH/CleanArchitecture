# A Clean Architecture .NET MAUI Solution Template

The project was generated using the [Xivotec.CleanArchitecture.Maui.Template](https://github.com/XivotecGmbH/CleanArchitecture.Maui) version 1.0

## Build

Run `dotnet build` to build the solution

## Run
Because .NET MAUI is packaged by default, `dotnet` run won't work.  
Instead, open the solution in Visual Studio and run from there.

## Test

The template contains example unit tests.
